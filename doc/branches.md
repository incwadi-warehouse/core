# Branches

Branches can only be created on the command line.

Find out what branches are existing and the corresponding id for a specific branch.

```shell
bin/console branch:list
```

Creating a new branch is straightforward. Replace `[NAME]` with your desired name.

```shell
bin/console branch:new [NAME]
```
